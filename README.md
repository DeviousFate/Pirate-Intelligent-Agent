# Pirate-Intelligent-Agent
CS370 Final

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, I worked on implementing a Deep Q-Learning Intelligent Agent to navigate a maze and find the treasure efficiently. The starter code provided the environment (TreasureMaze.py) and the experience replay system (GameExperience.py), while I was responsible for completing the Q-learning algorithm. By adjusting hyperparameters and optimizing training, I was able to improve the agentâ€™s performance, achieving 95.4% accuracy in 15 minutes.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer science is about solving problems through algorithms and computational thinking, and this project demonstrated how AI and machine learning contribute to real-world applications. From this experience, I learned how reinforcement learning allows an agent to improve decision-making over time, similar to how AI is used in robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems. Understanding how to structure training processes and refine models is a key aspect of artificial intelligence and data science.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first analyzing the requirements, breaking the problem into smaller manageable parts, and iterating over possible solutions. In this case, I needed to balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring the agent learned efficiently while avoiding unnecessary wandering. Debugging and fine-tuning were crucial in optimizing the model, reinforcing the importance of persistence and experimentation in machine learning.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethically, computer scientists must ensure that AI models are fair, unbiased, and transparent. Reinforcement learning can create unintended biases if not carefully managed, making it essential to evaluate outcomes and adjust training accordingly. Privacy, security, and accountability are also key responsibilities, as AI systems impact real-world decisions and must be developed with fairness and reliability in mind.
